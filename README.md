# üß† MISP Threat Intelligence Labs

This repository contains a series of hands-on labs designed to demonstrate how to use [MISP](https://www.misp-project.org/) (Malware Information Sharing Platform) to create, enrich, and manage cyber threat intelligence (CTI). These labs simulate realistic attack scenarios and walk through how to structure, classify, and share threat data effectively using MISP features such as events, attributes, objects, taxonomies, galaxies, and automation tools.

## üìå Purpose

The goal of this project is to help security analysts and CTI practitioners gain practical experience with:

- Creating MISP events based on real-world phishing and malware campaigns  
- Adding and classifying Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)
- Using taxonomies (e.g., TLP, ThreatMatch) for data labeling
- Mapping threats to MITRE ATT&CK and malware families using galaxy clusters
- Organizing IOCs into contextualized objects (e.g., malicious files)
- Automating IOC ingestion using MISP tools like freetext import

## üìÅ Lab Topics

Each lab focuses on a key MISP capability:

1. Creating and configuring MISP events  
2. Adding taxonomy-based tags  
3. Mapping threats to ATT&CK and malware (galaxies)  
4. Populating events with IOCs (manual and automated)  
5. Grouping intelligence using file and URL objects  

All labs are supported by screenshots and sample data to help you replicate each step in your own MISP instance.

## üöÄ Audience

This repository is ideal for:

- Security analysts  
- SOC and CTI team members  
- Red/Blue/Purple teamers  
- Students and professionals studying cyber threat intelligence
