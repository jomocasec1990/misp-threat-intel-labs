# ðŸ§  MISP Threat Intelligence Labs

This repository contains practical labs for learning how to use the [Malware Information Sharing Platform (MISP)](https://www.misp-project.org/) for cyber threat intelligence (CTI) operations. Each chapter focuses on real-world use cases to help security analysts and CTI practitioners gain hands-on experience.

The labs cover the entire workflow from setting up a MISP environment to enriching and analyzing Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) through automation.

## ðŸ“Œ What You Will Learn

- Deploying MISP with Docker on Ubuntu 20.04
- Creating and managing threat events
- Adding and classifying IOCs (IP, domains, URLs, files)
- Applying taxonomies and galaxy clusters for threat classification
- Using Malpedia and MITRE ATT&CK for TTP mapping
- Automating IOC searches and statistics with the MISP API
- Visualizing threat data using Python
